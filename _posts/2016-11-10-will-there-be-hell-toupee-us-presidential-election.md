**&#8220;Those who have the knowledge, don&#8217;t predict. Those who predict, don&#8217;t have the knowledge&#8221; &#8211; **_Lao Tzu &#8211; Chinese Poet &#8211; 6th Century BC_

Whilst I can&#8217;t speak about the first part of this quote (did anyone in the world have the knowledge?! &#8211; it was even reported that Trump spent a lot more time refining his losing speech than he did his victory speech) I can say that the second half of what Lao Tzu is saying is right on the mark. If you looked on the Huffington Post website before the votes were counted, you may have seen the following:

_“The HuffPost presidential forecast model gives Democrat Hillary Clinton a 98.2 percent chance of winning the presidency. Republican Donald Trump has essentially no path to an Electoral College victory.&#8221;_

It would be safe to say that their model did not have the knowledge. They were not on their own either, many other websites and news outlets gave similar odds, with the most conservative of them actually being around 70% to Clinton.

So.. what can we expect for the US economy now that they are months away from inaugurating their first president that has no prior experience in political office or the military? Well given his tendency for erratic decisions we probably can&#8217;t predict all that much, but you know what they say about predictions&#8230;

### Financial Markets

First of all, I will start by saying that in my opinion there has only been one time in my lifetime where selling everything was a good idea &#8211; and that was 2008. It wasn&#8217;t Black Wednesday, it wasn&#8217;t Brexit, it wasn&#8217;t the Russian Devaluation and its not this election. Pre-market trading showed the S&P was down 5%, if you look at the S&P now its up around 0.3% for the day &#8211; case closed. Obviously there will be some stocks and ETF&#8217;s (see yesterdays post for an example) that will take some time to recover (and I wouldn&#8217;t recommend looking at the Peso) but overall we have started to recover from the initial knee-jerk sell-off reaction. FYI Russian stocks and those of companies who are involved in defence (BAE hit an all time high) are up, make of that what you will.

We would also have to presume that many investors would not have overly aggressive portfolio&#8217;s, although company earnings are on the rise they aren&#8217;t moving rapidly &#8211; so short-term damage should be limited.

We also have to keep in mind that Clinton wasn&#8217;t exactly setting up to help the markets. Roughly 40% of the S&P is made of financial and healthcare companies, and she was proposing more banking regulation more bank taxes along with an increase in medicaid and a more thorough review of drug pricing &#8211; so the alternative could have done some damage.

### Economy

Trump is inheriting a healthy economy, one which is drastically different to what Obama got 8 years ago. Earnings are rising, albeit is slowly, and unemployment is good at 4.9%. This is a good base to start with and build upon.

When we look at what Trump has proposed on the campaign trail, its definitely questionable when you think of puting this into practise. He has said that he would look to give a tax bonus to the american people through cuts, but this could just leave a black hole in the governments accounts &#8211; not likely to get passed through the legislature, even if both houses in the US bicameralism system are controlled by his own party.

He also said that he wants to scale back, or eradicate, the universal healthcare system that is in place. In theory this may save millions, but in practise this is highly unlikely to be totally abolished.  I would believe that he would have to first propose an alternative, which may include manipulating the premiums that are involved with the scheme.

Both candidates have emphasised increased spending on infrastructure, both involving increased repatriation tax from offshore accounts. Clinton wanted to create an Infrastructure bank, in which government would add some cash, around $25 billion, which could be leveraged up to 10x to fund projects. Trump, it seems, wanted to use government money but also get some out of thin air to fund projects &#8211; it remains to be seen how much cash he can generate from a mix of Nitrogen, Oxygen and other gases. There is not much arguing that infrastructure would help the economy, even though it is estimated that it takes around 20 years for infrastructure to reach full productivity.

There are fears surrounding the idea that Trump could invoke the trade tariffs he spoke about on his campaign trail, for example charges on Mexican and Chinese exports &#8211; this could be the start of a global trade war. According to Morgan Stanley, China and South Korea are particularly exposed to any hostile measures as they run large surpluses with the US. He also has the power to kill the TPP deal which would stop it dead, and you&#8217;d have to think he would action the kill order. It does seem strange that someone who wants to &#8216;Make America Great Again&#8217; would essentially be promoting such a step back in globalisation.

On the subject of Mexico it is important to remember that their economy, whilst it does provide revenue for many US businesses, is about a 1/7th of the size of the healthcare industry in the US alone.

Trump&#8217;s policies could dramatically reduce the labour force in the US if he does go ahead with deportation plans. It remains to be seen the effect this would have and the scale at which it would be done. If you couple this with his desire for lower taxes and reformation of trade restrictions it is clear that he is planning a major changes in fiscal policy.

We would also have to bring into question the Fed. Trump has been critical of its actions and of Yellen, although she is unlikely to resign before her term ends in early-2018. A rate rate rise in December could be stalled with the probability of this happening going as low as 30%.

(_Edit: the probability of a rate rise has went back to pre-election levels of around 70%, and actually went as high as 80% as the market got to grips with the idea of Trump&#8217;s fiscal policy driving aggregate demand in the economy)_

Overall, from a purely economic sense, I would predict that the market has overreacted to this sudden and unexpected result in the very short-term. Looking longer-term, Trump&#8217;s slightly more outlandish proposals could get blocked or radically changed and he does have a good base to build upon, however predicting long-term economic trends is difficult with someone so volatile. As mentioned, however, those who predict may not have knowledge.
