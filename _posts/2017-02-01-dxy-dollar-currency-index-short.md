Downtrend showing on CCI , MACD and RSI . Also Elliot wave theory suggests a 5 stage pattern has been completed in both longer term (1-5) and shorter term (A-E)

I would expect that the levels return the support line on the downside; but if the currency moves upwards I would expect it to conform with the diagonal trend line.
