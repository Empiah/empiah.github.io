Back when we introduced the first model stock portfolio for Empiah Analysis at the end of March, we said that it was a Bottom Up portfolio (BUP). This means that we picked stocks that we liked and thought would perform well regardless of their industry/sector or where they were located in the world. We did not necessarily take note of our Market Outlook at the start of the year when it came to its broad predictions, and we did not look at stocks that were constrained to the buckets we thought would perform well.

At the same time that we were researching stocks for the BUP, we also looked at stocks that were the opposite of what was mentioned above and were constrained to our Market Outlook buckets in order to create a Top Down portfolio (TDP). As the name suggested, instead of looking at companies from the bottom up, we instead looked at parts of the economic landscape we thought would do well (we outlined these in our outlook) and then started to look at some of the stocks within those buckets we thought would outperform the market.

Some of the instruments are featured in both portfolio&#8217;s, as logically if we like a stock from a bottom-up perspective it makes sense to choose this if it fits the criteria and falls within one of our top-down buckets.

This portfolio &#8216;incepted&#8217; on the same day as the BUP, (27th March) and like the other portfolio it also started with 25 holdings. This portfolio is less diversified as there are essentially 5 sectors of the world economy that are included, meaning the associated risk would be high were someone to invest (we do not invest as is mentioned in our disclaimer).

We believe that the portfolio turnover will be lower on this when compared to the BUP unless we see a big change in the macro environment which causes us to revise our outlook. We will however be monitoring the holdings actively and will change if we believe it to be necessary.

Below is the full performance vs benchmark. As you can see there was a sustained period of underperformance vs the benchmark, but we finished April in line and are now outperforming and have generated substantial alpha:

Going forward we will be monitoring both model portfolio&#8217;s on a monthly basis and will provide ad hoc updates if necessary.
