Looking at the EURSEK we can see that it is coming to an important level where there has been some support and resistance in the past. I would expect this to rebound and head towards around 9.6. RSI is indicating that this is close to being oversold and CCI is also indicating that there is some momentum upwards.

If this line is broken on the downside I would look for the currency to go down to around 9.35; where again there has been some support and resistance previously.
