The graph below shows how we predicted the USDCAD to bounce back from yesterday lows; and the big jump today has proved the prediction to be correct. The main analysis done here was using Elliot Wave theory.

This graph shows a channel created from August to mid-November, and an upwards 5 point trend. This was followed by a 3 step downward pattern which was completed yesterday. We can see from this chart that it dropped to the 0.236 fib line (2016 h/l), and on a 4 hour chart the first meaningful green bar was a sign of a rise. Other indicators here were the RSI which indicated that USDCAD was close to being oversold, and the CCI which was looking to trend upwards. We predict that this will eventually rise to a lower high of 0.382 fib, with a Â secondary target of 0.5, then start another trend downwards.
