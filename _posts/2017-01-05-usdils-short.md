There is a wedge forming for USDILS which is indicating that the currency will start on a downtrend. I believe that the currency will go down to around 3.72 which was a previous low in April 2016.  
We can also see a downtrend showing on the RSI and CCI which further supports the ideology that a downtrend is likely to take place.  
**EDIT:** I am moving up my target to 3.7889, or fib 0.618. I am keeping my original prediction as a secondary target.

The reason that I have moved this is that on second review; there is some volatility around this price area previously and it has served as a <span class="tv-chart-view__tag-page-link">support and resistance</span> in the past
