As you may know there are many firms, for example Renaissance Technologies, that look to ingest all kinds of numbers and see if there is any correlation between the data and the performance of stocks or indexes. Essentially, instead of having hundreds of &#8216;CFA&#8217; research analysts going through 10-K&#8217;s, they have hundreds of PhD&#8217;s writing code that goes into the big black box in the corner of the room. The kind of data that they feed the machine is extremely varied and one commonly used example is regarding the weather in France and the CAC performance. This method of investing is clearly very profitable, with the secretive &#8216;Medallion&#8217; fund being one of the best performing funds around.

Sadly I don&#8217;t have any ex-IBM Watson Programmers or any other PhD&#8217;s working with me so the chances of Empiah Analysis developing the next big deep learning-neural net-\*insert buzz word here\* algorithm is slim to say the least. Instead, I do have a list of the Tube Strikes that have happened from 2012 to 2016, with a list of what lines were affected and dates. My initial thoughts are that there will be no, or little, correlation between the two but as I have the information to hand I thought it would be interesting to take a look.

Below is what I was told was the definition of strike, so it may be the case that not everything is captured if it does meet this criteria. There may also be some irregularities in dates, as is also explained below:

> A strike is what is normally referred to as a withdrawal of labour from an organised group of employees in protest to the organisation’s action or proposed course of action in a particular matter. The impact of any strike action taken against the organisation varies and is dependent on the nature of the dispute, the number of unions involved and where the strike has been called. Therefore the impact of the strikes listed below vary from affecting the whole tube network to localised action affecting only part of the network.
> 
> We do not hold data for precisely when each strike was called over these years. The dates provided are the information we hold but there may be some differences from actual strike dates due to the varying start and finish times of such action having different impact on each day’s service.

It is also worth noting that at times of tube strikes, London does not simply come to a standstill. There are additional members of staff deployed along with more buses and river services operating to help people get around.

Also, I haven&#8217;t posted the exact dates that I have for the strikes (as I believe there is some law about sharing this data without prior consent), but I have posted the return data I have got. I have used 3 indices; the FTSE 100, FTSE All Share and S&P 500. Note that any blanks are because the exchanges were not open, due to weekends or Bank Holidays.

Lastly, the numbers in the three rows at the bottom of the charts below show the bias of positive vs negative returns. If there were only positive/negative results it would show 100%, and if there was an even number of both positive and negative, it would show 0%. The idea is that the closer it is to 100%, the more of a possible trading opportunity it is. All numbers are based upon the first day of striking, and the day count refers to business days only ( e.g. 5 days=1 week) and if the columns reference more than one day, that is the performance over that whole period.

## FTSE 100

Summary:

  * The average return for all but one period is negative.
  * There is stronger bias 10 days before the strike and 1 day prior to the strike.  With no strong bias after the event.
  * The two 100% bias come for network wide strikes 10 days before, and on single lines strikes one day before.

## FTSE All-Share

Summary:

  * Much the same as the FTSE 100
  * There is again, stronger bias 10 days before the strike and 1 day prior to the strike. With no strong bias after the strike.
  * The two 100% bias come for single line strikes 10 days before, and on single lines strikes one day before.

## S&P 500

Summary:

This was put in as a mere comparison &#8211; but the results are quite interesting.

  * There is even stronger bias 10 days before the event. With no negative returns at all.
  * Stronger bias after the event. Noting here the number at or above 50% on the day of the striking and the rolling return 5 days after.

## Overall

Overall, there is a lot more correlation here than I first thought. We can see that 10 days before there is a strike that the indices tend to have positive returns, whilst they are seemingly unaffected post-strike, with the exception of some minor correlation for the S&P 500.

I would imagine that if this was any use it would have already been digested by the data-driven trading firms out there, but I hope it provided an interesting insight into the kind of things that could be correlated to positive performance.
