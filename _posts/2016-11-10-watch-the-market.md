Before I delve into this &#8211; I want to state that this idea has no real way of working, but instead is an interesting (to me anyway) concept.

There are many different things that people can invest in when looking to generate returns in the financial markets; shares, bonds, derivatives, commodities and more. One thing that is missing is a contract that can be used to invest in classic watches.

Rare and classic watches have shot up in value in the last decade or so. If you bought a certain model of the Rolex Datejust in 2004 you would look to pay around $4000, in 2014 this would have risen to $6500. This would generate returns of 62.50% over the period, or 4.97% annually &#8211; not bad. In the same period the S&P 500 returned 69.89%, or 5.44% annually, but hey you can&#8217;t wear that around you wrist and reap in those compliments can you? This isn&#8217;t even the most profitable example for a watch, a Panerai Radiomir bought over the same period rose a massive 260% (13.67% annually), now no-one would turn that down.

Actually dealing in physical watches wouldn&#8217;t work though. There is of course a supply issue involved, and if more watches were made to obligate the deals it could affect the share price of the company that makes the product or impact their consumers. Instead it would have to be a type of Non Deliverable Forward where the P/L of the deal depends on the divergence from the agreed forward price and the spot price.

So far this could actually make some kind of sense, but the main issue is getting the prices of the underlying assets. Given that these are classic watches we couldn&#8217;t use prices listed by manufacturers as the models would not be made anymore, so it would have to be prices from second-hand dealers. There is no index or exchange where these watch prices are listed or tracked so one would have to be made. What could be done is to call round some dealers and get an average (think LIBOR), but these prices may not change much over long periods of time. This part of the plan needs some thought &#8211; please feel free to contact me if you have any ideas.

Given that prices tend to go one way, up, there could be some issues in getting investors to take both sides of the trade. When the economy is booming and household disposable incomes are rising, prices could sky rocket, but then prices may rise faster on more expensive models and cheapen others? Pop-culture may also have an impact on price, if the Panerai Radiomir is suddenly worn by Kanye West it may increase its value even more, and if Donald Trump wears it the price may go down (although from experience he can pull off surprises). In the real world this could be the equivalent of a Hedge Fund disclosing their holdings in their 13F form or announcing an investment publicly, but as Ackman found out with his Valeant bet, this doesn&#8217;t necessarily help increase the price. Inflation could also cause changes, but this is something that already affects securities currently available.

To me this is an interesting idea (albeit with many complications and flaws), to others it may be boring and ridiculous, but it does raise the question of what else will be structured and put into investable products in the future.
