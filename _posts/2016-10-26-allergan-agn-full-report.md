The fundamental financials of Allergan are strong; they show increasing revenue and earnings that are above analyst expectations. They have since looked to expand their Gastroenterology pipeline by acquiring Gastrointestinal (GI) Disease subsidiary of Rhythm Holdings Company LLC,  Motus Therapeutics, a biopharma company developing peptide therapeutics for the treatment of GI disorders (27/10).

As a result of exercising its option to acquire Motus Therapeutics, Allergan will pay the exercise price of $200 million at closing to Rhythm Holding. In addition, Rhythm Holding will be eligible for a contingent payment upon first commercial sale of relamorelin. Allergan previously made $47 million in payments related to the option-to-acquire Motus and the relamorelin Phase 2b clinical trial. Completion of Allergan&#8217;sacquisition of Motus Therapeutics is expected to occur by the end of 2016 subject to customary closing conditions (Source: Allergan Press Release).

This acquisition is in addition to the completion of the tender offer for Vitae (25/10) a clinical-stage BioPharma company focused on dermatological issues, where they purchased all outstanding shares for $21 per share, for a total transaction value of approx. $639 million. These are two of many acquisitions by the company in the last few weeks, Tobira Therapeutics (20/09) and Akarna Therapeutics (20/09) being some of the others.

The additional research, products and expertise that these companies will bring is a positive sign for the company, and one which adds to the positive recommendation.

There is also clear growth in the Medical Aesthetics area in products which are key to the company. If this growth continues, which I believe is indicated by the data, then there will be increased revenues in this area of the business. The acquisition of Topokine Therapeutics also helps bring in new products into this area which complement what they already offer.

We would look at the uptake of rival’s products and how they would affect the sales of Allergan’s products. An example of this would be Shire’s Xiidra (lifitegrast) for dry eye and its impact on Restasis. Restasis is the second highest revenue generator for the firm, so if market share is lost it could impact the performance of Allergan. Shire’s product was launched in August so the full extent may not be fully known until the end of the year, however analysts estimate sales of $1b or more. The products are priced the same, so we would expect to see an increase in marketing spend as the head-to-head battle starts. It could also be argued that Restasis could benefit from the increased awareness of dry-eye related diseases (source: pmlive.com).

In addition to strong fundamentals, the stock also shows promise from a technical perspective. We can see that an uptrend is forming which I believe will continue to the post-Pfizer era high of around 260.
