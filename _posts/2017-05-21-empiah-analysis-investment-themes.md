We have mentioned previously some investment themes that Empiah Analysis believes will show profit in the future; and in this article we will talk through these themes.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Internet of Things (IoT)

AI and IoT attracted about half of InnerTech funding globally in 2016; which when you think of all the different avenues of technology is really astonishing. In addition, Venture Capitalist invested $5 billion in 658 different AI companies, a 61% increase, whilst corporations bought around 40 AI companies. This goes to show the potential growth in this sector and also the potential profitability (VC), whilst although indicating that larger corporations view this new technology as a threat.

AI has been marketed direct to consumers through such products as Amazon Alexa and Google Home which give a simplistic taste of the what the technology can do. There is also an increased trend of household appliances (and cars) being connected to the internet. Google bought Nest in January 2014 for $3.2 billion, which is a company that focuses on things such as thermostats and smoke alarms that can be controlled by your phone via the internet.

We also believe that this is a big trend in the automotive industry that will change not only car companies and there customers lives, but also the lives of people working in other fields. For example Truck driving, which was the most common job in 28 US states in 2014, could be automated by companies such as Otto who&#8217;s parent company is Uber.

It is not only the companies that are building the cars (Google with Waymo, Tesla etc.) that we are looking at, but also companies that power the technology behind it. This list includes powerhouses such as Nvidia. We believe that the growing capital that is flowing into IoT and AI will fuel continued innovation by these same chipmakers, which will catapult the growth in this area.

Research by consulting firm BCG estimates that by 2025 the driverless market will be worth $42 billion, then $77 billion by 2035, by which time there will be about 76 million autonomous vehicles on the road. The biggest markets are thought to be the US and China but when the technology gets better it could explode and move in to other countries with more developed infrastructure e.g. Western Europe.

There are of course some hurdles that have to be overcome. The biggest one in our opinion being regulation. Trusting technology with someones life is huge and we think that there could be some states, or countries, that will seriously object. I mean there is already a movement to ban driverless cars in New York City, for fear of them upstaging the famous yellow cabs.

### Marijuana Industry Growth

Marijuana is not only something that is becoming legal for recreational use, it is also becoming used more wildly by Pharmaceutical companies as the health benefits become more widely know.

We look at the bigger companies that are using Marijuana as part of a wider portfolio of products, as there are some challenges associated to its use and of course regulation may prevent things like FDA approval becoming granted.

AbbVie already has FDA approval for its Marinol drug that is used for treating Nausea in chemotherapy patients (one of the key benefits touted in Marijuana legalisation). There is also promising results that it will help AIDS patients who find it hard to eat. This of course is not Abbvie&#8217;s biggest selling drug but it show that the plant can get FDA approval and can be used within the healthcare industry.

GW Pharmaceutical is a smaller company that is working on many products relating to the drug; and one of its key drugs, Epidiolex, is up for FDA approval this year. This drug is used to try and treat the seizures of infant epilepsy.

We believe that whilst Marijuana is not extensively used in the industry now, as state legalisation is more widespread and as research highlights more benefits &#8211; it will be used more and more by others in Big-Pharma, even though currently some of the industry is bank-rolling the &#8216;Anti-Marijuana&#8217; side of the argument (Pharmaceutical company Insys spent $500,000 to block legalisation in Arizona. Five months later it won approval for a cannabis-derived medical drug).

And even if some are opposed to the drug, it is hard to deny that it is saving lives as there are 25% less reported deaths due to Opioid overdose in states where Marijuana has been legalised. Combine this and soaring prescription drug prices (130% since 2008), and you can see why Pharma are monitoring the situation.

If we take a step back from healthcare, ScottsMiracle-Gro is developing products for growers, including developments in pesticides. The decision to start selling hydroponic&#8217;s and other equipment came in 2013 and the company spent around $500 million on buying companies that already specialised in the field.

There is a large group of people that believe that the marijuana industry will hurt alcohol sales, however we believe that the novelty of this would wear off and look to hold Ambev.

### Financial De-regulation

One of the main themes of the Trump presidency was the thought of bank de-regulation, and banks soared after the results of the elections were announced. It has only been slightly more recently that this theme has been brought back up, with the idea of getting a new version of &#8216;Glass-Steagall&#8217;, even though that seems to be a synonym for general bank regulation of any kind, and also a repeal of the &#8216;Volker&#8217; rule. Even though Trump was seen a an atypical republican, this seems like a more typical republican idea where he wants the finance sector to flourish.

Trump&#8217;s temporary pick for Acting OCC head (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) is Keith Noreika, who is bullish on banks and is open to easing limits that are placed  on them. Even though he is acting head, it is thought that it will be some tie before an official head is announced. Also Mnuchin and Trump have previously echoed that they want to prevent any obstacles that affect bank lending.

There is also the much talked about Interest Rates play. Companies with large deposits, e.g. Bank of America, will also benefit from any interest rate rises that happen in 2017. Because they have large stockpiles, nearly $450 billion, in which they don&#8217;t pay interest (e.g. checking accounts); if the federal reserve hikes rates by 1% in 2017 they can expect to collect an additional $5.3 billion.

### Emerging Markets Strength

Although the recent Political crisis in Brazil has caused Emerging Markets to falter, we still believe that there is room to run if the correct companies are selected.

At the start of the year there were a number of things that people thought would affect EM; a rising dollar, rising commodity prices and the &#8216;Trump affect&#8217;. It has actually turned out that the opposite has been the case. We have seen a [falling dollar](https://empiah-analysis.com/2017/02/01/dxy-dollar-currency-index-short/), falling commodity prices and the Trump affect has not been as bad as previously thought.

One stock that we have looked at is Infosys. Infosys is India&#8217;s number 2 technology firm and it is at almost its lowest valuation in 20 years. We believe that some of the negative news (H1B visas) has been priced in and that the company is poised to rise. It is diversified geographically, with development centres in India, the Asia Pacific, the Americas and Europe.They also have clients in more than 50 countries.

We are passionate about the fact that Emerging Markets are one of the biggest next generation sources of land and labour, and capital injections are the key to unlocking and utilising this productivity.

### Alternative Energy

Alternative Energy is an area where we do not yet have any holdings in our Top Down portfolio, but it is somewhere that we believe shows promise for the future. Oil rising shows a economic backdrop where traditional energy companies may thrive, but we think that an alternative energy still has a place.

For investors in large cap companies, you can view alternative energy as almost a small-cap investment with high risk and high reward. Different areas of alternative energy can pop-up and become very successful but some may not work on a larger scale or might take longer to become a reality e.g. Nuclear Fusion Power.

If we look at the wider world preferences, we can see a definite shift in recent years to cleaner vehicles. A few years ago a Prius was the only thing that consumers could buy, but now automotive companies are making all kinds of hybrid and pure electric vehicles with charging stations becoming far more common. Tesla is a world leader in this space with its Solar City arm looking at solar energy too.

Increasing technological advancements are making it easier to harness the energy that is captured. Solar City have unveiled new panels which look better than the normal solar set-up on houses and are likely to appeal to more consumers and could be used on new builds, and we believe that getting these type of clean energy ideas into the hands of every day people is a major step in their advancement.

In the investment landscape, Octopus Investments have recently closed a £300m funding for clean energy fund, and the company itself has £2.1bn of clean energy assets under management.

We will write more about Alternative Energy as we research more into this sector.

### Summary

As we mentioned before, we have kept the Themes short and at a summary level. But we believe that the above will provide strong investment returns in the long-term. If there are any changes we will write an updated article.
