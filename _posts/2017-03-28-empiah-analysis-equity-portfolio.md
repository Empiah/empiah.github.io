Empiah Analysis has put together a portfolio of holdings which we believe are well placed to perform strongly in the market. Our holdings have been picked in a bottom-up style manner, meaning that have been selected based upon their individual merits. It is however clear that the sectors mentioned in our Market Outlook are represented heavily.

Our portfolio carries a high risk level given that it has only 25 holdings, with large portions of the portfolio going to certain stocks. It has a US Market Correlation of around 0.82.

We will continually review our holdings and will aim to provide monthly updates as to its performance and allocation.
