It is impossible to ignore the rise of crypto at the moment, and due to the jump in IOTA in the last 24 hours we wanted to do some research to see how it was different to all the others out there. Below is what we found &#8211; here is the link of the pdf &#8211; [IOTA Primer](https://empiahanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/iota-primer.pdf "IOTA Primer")

This is purely informational and is not intended to be a stamp of approval on this or any crypto-currencies.

# IOTA

IOTA is a new breed of crypto currency that does not use Blockchain – instead, it uses a technology it’s developers call ‘Tangle’. This is based on a mathematical concept and it is what separates IOTA from other crypto currencies. What this does it remove the need for miners which in turn means that there are no transactions fees. Instead of mining, every time a transaction is made, the issuer will help authenticate and validate two random transactions via use the of algorithms. Now come the big selling points, micro-transactions and speed. Micro-transactions mean that you could use IOTA to theoretically buy a cup of coffee (Bitcoin is not optimized for this due to its size and the necessity of miners), and the speed relates to the amount of transactions per second (TPS). The more IOTA scales, and the more people use the network, the faster it becomes – this alleviates some of the issues that blockchain based crypto-currencies face today. The goal of IOTA is to facilitate the machine-to-machine economy and to become the underlying protocol of the Internet of Things (IoT), a section that has grown massively in recent times.

## Supply

The maximum and currency circulating supply of IOTA is 2,779,530,283,277,761i. It is broken down into 6 tiers of measurement; i (one IOTA), Ki (one thousand), Mi (one million), Gi (One billion), Ti and Pi (one quadrillion IOTA’s – half of total supply). The easiest way to think about supply is that there are 2,779,530 Gi’s, and the different tiers as different bank notes of traditional currencies.

## TPS

PayPal handles around 115 TPS and Visa handles around 3-4 thousand TPS. If you are a crypto-currency and you really want to take on the traditional monetary system, you have to try and get in and around this kind of area. If we look at other crypto’s, Bitcoin currently handles around 3-5 TPS, Ether is around 15 TPS and Ripple does better at around 1500 TPS according to reports at the start of November. IOTA, according to its latest stress tests, sits at around 1000 TPS. This may seem like a reason to all move into Ripple, but because of the way IOTA is set-up, the more users mean faster speeds – with the theoretical limits being laws of Physics and Bandwidth.

## IoT

IOTA wants to facilitate the IoT world, it does this by providing a value and informational transfer system in which the transactions are near instant, secure (masked authentication messaging and creation of unseen sensor networks) and scalable. It believes that as IoT progresses there will be a need for an underlying network which supports it. Case studies that the platform provides are the use of environmental and cold chain monitoring. For example, a shipment of pharmaceuticals that need to be kept at a certain temperature. It may be the case where you cannot trust any one entity to hold the data, which is where the traditional distributed ledger technology comes in.

## Partnerships

As at the end of October 207 – IOTA had partnerships with RuuviTag, an open source sensor system, and Innogy who deal with the problem of vehicle history for second hand cars (who switched from Ethereum to IOTA). The big news has come recently with [partnerships with a number of big tech firms](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/04/cryptocurrency-iota-rallies-after-launch-of-data-marketplace.html), including Microsoft and Samsung, on a ‘Data Marketplace’. What the platform will do is let the companies sell data which would otherwise be wasted.
