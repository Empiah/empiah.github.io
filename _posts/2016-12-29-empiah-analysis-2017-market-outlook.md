After what has been an eventful 2016, it is time for investors to look towards next year and position themselves in the world market.

2016 has been the year that the unthinkable has happened, and although this could be seen to negatively impact the general public, it has in some cases led to massive gains for investors. The main example of this if of course the Trump nomination. As we can see from the below, the S&P500 has climbed ever since this Trump nomination, and has proved easy money for for people who got in early; if we look at Metals & Mining and Financials stocks we can see that this growth has been even more apparent.

Looking into the future we believe that this extreme growth will stop, and that 2017 will show lower annual returns in the US market. We also believe that the US Dollar will strengthen in value due to expectations of growth and interest rate rises. These ideas will be further explained in the following sections.

## Equities

### United States

2016 was a year where hedge funds got hammered and passive investing strategies were king. We believe however, that in the US 2017 will have better conditions for active stock pickers, with individual companies and sectors poised to outperform wider benchmarks.

In the US we are bullish on certain sectors but remain flat overall. We believe that valuations are elevated, as P/E ratios have grown since 2011 and stocks seem expensive relative to their earnings. The sectors that we are bullish on in the US are Technology/IT companies and Financials.

Technology will play a massive part in 2017, with innovations like &#8216;Drone Deliveries&#8217; poised to reshape our day to day lives as we know it. Companies like LAM Research, who make equipment that large companies use to put flash memory into components, are also likely to see an increase in demand as the competition for speed in Phones/Computers hots up.

Financials in the US are growing in strength relative to the S&P500 and have been since 2011. Companies with large deposits, e.g. Bank of America, will also benefit from any interest rate rises that happen in 2017. Because they have large stockpiles, nearly $450 billion, in which they don&#8217;t pay interest (e.g. checking accounts); if the federal reserve hikes rates by 1% in 2017 they can expect to collect an additional $5.3 billion (source: Fortune). Financials are also poised to benefit from less regulation, something that has been one of Trump&#8217;s key policies.

Looking at the short-term, we believe that some of the Trump Trades that have proved prosperous recently will return to normal levels. Some Steel/Industrial/Construction stocks have shot up 50%+, and this doesn&#8217;t look right to us.

### Rest of the World

We see a strong US Dollar and rising US interest rates as headwinds to Emerging Markets although we believe that fundamentals are improving and that stocks are reasonably valued. We think that a strong US Dollar relative to EM currencies does mean that some stocks could picked up for cheaper.Overall we are bullish on EM.

In Europe we think that the uncertainty around Brexit causes issues and Trumps US trade policies are still not clear. There are also some important elections coming up, in particular the French election which has the first round coming up in April 2017. In that election stands Marine Le Pen, the Right wing Eurosceptic, and although it is unlikely that she will be victorious, her appointment could spell the end of the Eurozone if she chooses to withdraw &#8211; something much more devastating to the world economy than Brexit or Trump. Overall we are skeptical about Europe due to the fact that there are many unknowns, and are flat.

## Fixed Income

We are bearish on US Government Bonds, due to a potential rise in inflation caused by Trump&#8217;s fiscal policy &#8211; because of this we would prefer TIPS. We also believe that the proposed interest rate rises will challenge longer-term bonds. Stronger growth also leads us to prefer US Credit over Treasuries &#8211; especially in Financials where less regulation has been one of Trump&#8217;s policies.

## Conclusion

I hope that this has been informative &#8211; please see below for summary of the key points that we have made:

Equities:

  * US &#8211; Flat Overall 
      * Technology &#8211; Bullish
      * Financials &#8211; Bullish
      * Healthcare &#8211; Bullish
  * Europe &#8211; Flat
  * Emerging Markets &#8211; Bullish

Fixed Income:

  * US Government Bonds &#8211; Bearish
  * US Credit &#8211; Bullish

We see 2017 really emphasising the need for diversification in portfolio&#8217;s. The end of year has shown equity returns rising and bond returns falling showing the requirement for a balanced multi-asset portfolio.
