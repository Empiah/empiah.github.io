I feel like everything I have read in the last few months has been about the yield curve. It is hard to read research, listen to a podcast or go on twitter for long before I see or hear about the 3 month UST yield heading above the 10 year UST yield (or now the 2Y and 10Y), since it happened back in late March.

A lot of articles (especially those on less reputable sites) use this to warn of an impending crash in the markets and direct readers to move quickly to cash, [gold](https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/yield-curve-inverted-even-more-is-it-finally-time-for-buying-gold-201903281350) or even [bitcoin](https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/08/15/what-is-us-yield-curve-and-why-is-it-tickling-bitcoin-investors/) (any excuse for that crypto lot).

For those that may not know what I am talking about, [here](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-countdown-to-recession-what-an-inverted-yield-curve-means-idUKKCN1V320S) is an article from Reuters that will help explain it all, but in short and basic terms, an inversion signals an expectation of weaker growth in the future.

To help visualise, below is a graph of the US yield curve back at the end of February (red line) and as at 23rd August. You can see that in February, the yield for 10 years was higher than that for 3 months. This makes intuitive sense as an investor would be taking on more risk by holding a longer dated instrument (more time for something to happen), the blue line shows this isn&#8217;t the case now.

Given all of this hype and all of these articles, we wanted to see how the market (S&P 500 in this case) has performed in the 1000 days after previous inversions.

## Does the market have the legs?

For this analysis we are using the S&P500 as a measure for broader market performance. We are taking the dates of previous inversions, using that as a base, and then plotting the performance of the S&P500 1000 days into the future. The idea is that this will give us an idea as to what we may be able to expect. Obviously every market cycle is different, and the drivers of this market are different from say, 2007 &#8211; so we will take any results with a pinch of salt.

### 3 Month vs 10 Year Inversions

The date in the legend represents the month and year of the occurrence. The information since March 2019 has not run its full course yet, but available data has been plotted.

Here we can see that the 2000 dot-com bubble and the 2007 financial crisis are really leading the pack on the wrong side of the dotted line, showing negative performance over the period, with the other instances showing neutral to positive performance. Excluding 2000, however, even 2007 took around 675 days after inversion before we really saw negative performance.

### 2 Year vs 10 Year Inversions

The date in the legend represents the month and year of the occurrence. Given how recent the 2Y/10Y inverted in 2019, we don&#8217;t have a track record yet, so this has been excluded from the below.

This isn&#8217;t far off a mirror image of the graph above. Here we can see that 2007 took slightly longer for the effects to be felt and the overall performance is more muted.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this analysis has showed that there is some room to run based on previous data, even a 2007-era style crash would still take some time to materialise.

This information should be taken with a pinch of salt however. As mentioned previously, all market crashes can be triggered by something unexpected, with the two negative examples above caused by different bubbles (tech stocks & housing). The above doesn&#8217;t mean that we will see the above scenarios play out again.

In the market currently, for example, we see over [$12.5trn invested in negative yielding debt worldwide](https://www.ft.com/content/a1899c76-92a8-11e9-aea1-2b1d33ac3271) , markets that have been dominated by growth and historical under performance of value as an investment cycle &#8211; these could all cause behaviour different to what have ever seen before.
