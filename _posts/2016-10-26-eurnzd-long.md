Upward trend since end of September broken when close below short term support and resistance 1.5483, fall to July lows presents buying opportunity. Look to go towards longer support and resistance of 1.5834. If this is broken and goes above 2016 high/low fib retracement 0.3821 we could expect returns to long term support line (and fib retracement 0.5) of 1.61. Note bounce on CCI from this area historically.
