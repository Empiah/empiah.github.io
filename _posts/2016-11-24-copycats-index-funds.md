Quite simply as the name suggests, index funds are funds with a portfolio constructed to match or track that of a market index &#8211; therefore they are labelled as being passively managed. This market index might be the S&P 500, the Russell 2000 index and I am sure you could find one that tracks the Dow Jones Summer/Winter Games Index (index of corporations sponsoring the Summer and Winter Olympics).

Unless you&#8217;ve been living under a rock, you&#8217;ll know that they have become pretty popular in recent years, for many reason. They can be very low cost, due to the fact that they have low operating expenses and no requirement for research analysts; they also give broad market exposure and have low portfolio turnover. As we can see from the chart below, there has been a massive move from Active into Passive management in the last year:

<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-545" src="https://empiahanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-24-at-00-11-01.png?resize=552%2C346" alt="screen-shot-2016-11-24-at-00-11-01" width="552" height="346" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

Given the fact that many active managers, especially hedge funds, are experiencing relative underperformance recently compared to index&#8217;s such as the S&P 500, you can see why this move has been so popular. According to research by [S&P](https://www.ft.com/content/e139d940-977d-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582), 99 per cent of actively managed US equity funds sold in Europe have failed to beat the S&P 500 over the past 10 years, while only two in every 100 global equity funds have outperformed the S&P Global 1200 since 2006. Almost 97 per cent of emerging market funds have underperformed.

So far, things aren&#8217;t looking good for active management. I mean, would you rather get a cheap index tracker, or pay 2 and 20 for Ackman to lose your money on a wild Valeant bet? Actually Ackman is offering a [new share class](http://uk.businessinsider.com/bill-ackmans-pershing-square-shaking-up-fee-structure-2016-10) to existing and future clients in which he will not charge any performance fee on gains less than 5 percent; after that, the performance fee will be 30 percent- but we are straying from the point.

It isn&#8217;t all sunshine and rainbows for passive management though &#8211; there are also some questions regarding this method of investing.

For example, what if everyone invested in index trackers? I mean at the moment this is not something we have to fear; roughly [10% of corporate equity assets](http://indexfundadviser.com) are invested in index funds or ETF&#8217;s but, just for fun, lets think of this theoretically. If everyone was to go head over heels for index funds then no-one would be able to set prices based on business fundamentals &#8211; basically, the market wouldn&#8217;t work. This is becuase there would be no point in anyone doing research on companies and marking them based on different factors. Not good. This would make for a very boring stock market that wouldn&#8217;t work like it does today. This situation is highly unlikely to happen however.

Matt Levine talks in his blog &#8216;[Money Stuff](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/contributors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine)&#8216; about another perceived issue with index funds. This issue isn&#8217;t related to the performance of them or there invest-ability, but that if you add all a firms index fund&#8217;s positions together, they can count for a large percentage of holdings in certain companies. This means that when it comes down to voting on certain issues, they carry a huge amount of power. One perceived way that Levine says we could get around this is by using swaps. Essentially, the index funds would sell the underlying asset and enter into a total return swap, so they have direct exposure but no ability to vote. On the other side, an investor would sell the exact same total return swap and buy the share. This would lead them to have voting rights but no exposure. Make sense? A very interesting concept. There is of course problems with this, I believe there are limits on funds holding swaps, and it also means that activist investors could buy these swaps and have a massive amount of voting rights, meaning that they could have a large impact on big companies.

He also talks about the theory that ownership of multiple firms in the same industry  could be an antitrust problem. The idea can arise from the fact that by holding multiple firms, you are not hoping for one firm to do well, instead you just care about the wider industry. This could funnel down to management, where instead of competing with other companies by say, investing in more stock or slashing prices to drive demand, they just sit there. Nice and steady.

Plus, if people just put money into indexes, they could never generate returns that better than the index by a meaningful amount. If you invest in the right fund, or open a discretionary account with the right manger, you can beat the index. Some funds, for example (even though its closed to outside investors) the extremely secretive Renaissance Medallion fund have generated massive returns in recent year.

Overall, there is a great case for investors to use index funds; but if you want to have a shot at outperforming them, you can turn down the temptations of firms like Vanguard and go towards an active managers.
