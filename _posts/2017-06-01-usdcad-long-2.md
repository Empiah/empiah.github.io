USDCAD has hit the upward diagonal trend line and kicked off the 5th stretch of the 1-5 Elliot Wave Pattern. When it reaches around 1.4 I would look for a downtrend through 1.39 to signal an ABC downward trend. The CCI is showing upward momentum as is the RSI and I would also look for the MACD to cross to further reiterate this long.
