The chart above (I know this is hard to read but I wanted to get a lot of data in there) shows the RSI numbers of the S&P 500 vs the VIX. The below is a detailed description from [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Relative_Strength_Index_(RSI)) of what RSI does, but essentially it is a technical indicator which tells us if a market is oversold (RSI below 30) or overbought (above 70), we can use this to predict a future fall or rise in the price of an asset.

> The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a well versed momentum based oscillator which is used to measure the speed (velocity) as well as the change (magnitude) of directional price movements. Essentially RSI, when graphed, provides a visual mean to monitor both the current, as well as historical, strength and weakness of a particular market. The strength or weakness is based on closing prices over the duration of a specified trading period creating a reliable metric of price and momentum changes. Given the popularity of cash settled instruments (stock indexes) and leveraged financial products (the entire field of derivatives); RSI has proven to be a viable indicator of price movements.
> 
> Specifically, RSI operates between a scale of 0 and 100. The closer RSI is to 0, the weaker the momentum is for price movements. The opposite is also true. An RSI closer to 100 indicates a period of stronger momentum.

You can use the below to calculate this yourself (which is what we did to get the graph above)

> <span class="nx">RSI</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">100</span> <span class="nx">â€“</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="o">/</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">RS</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nx">RS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Average</span> <span class="nx">Gain</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="nx">Average</span> <span class="nx">Loss</span>

What we can see is that the S&P tends to be oversold when the VIX is undersold, which is to be expected, but there are some moves that are disproportional from one to the other, indicating the the correlation between the two is not always so exact. The most recent example of this is at the start of 2017, where the 14 day number (most commonly used) shows a slowly rising VIX, against an S&P that is showing as overbought.
