Unilever financials for the third quarter do not paint a positive picture, they show falling revenue year on year and a decline in Emerging Market turnover which is where most their turnover stems from.

This could be attributed to rising commodity costs and higher input costs in local currencies. These costs are being passed onto consumers, and in India has caused a lack in demand in their skin cleansing products.

The driver of turnover has been price instead of volume in the third quarter, showing a lack of overall demand for products, a negative sign for the company.

We believe that this may continue into 2017 as prices of commodities continue to look strong due to currency instability. Crude Oil prices for instance have risen over 50% this year. Unilever is exposed to multiple currency movements due to its multinational reach, which would affect earnings and sales.

On the positive side, the acquisition of Dollar Shave Club is a step in the right direction. The use of Unilever’s expertise gained in its other brands, coupled with the upwards directory of the razor subscription service in terms of turnover could help drive market share away from Gillette. The male grooming market is forecast to grow 3.3% through 2020 so getting on the bandwagon will help generate turnover. This also helps the company make a move of physical shelf space, which is becoming less powerful, and into e-commerce which is rapidly growing.

The partnership with Convoy will help reduce operating costs in North America and reduce the number of empty miles being driven – it will also help reduce their carbon footprint which is in line with Unilever’s sustainability focus.

We forecast that the top-line growth will be in line with competitors, and within the 3-5% aim that Unilever work towards.

Overall, although technical analysis predicted that there would be a drop in price we think that this will be only in the short term as turnover continues to be driven by price in this economic environment. Looking longer term we believe that sales will pick up in emerging markets and volume will increase, and that the stock price will increase looking to the end of 2017.
