It seems almost a given now that each year, banks will shell out billions in fines for breaking various laws in different countries. As a matter of fact there have been around $300 billion in fines since the global financial crisis, and there is no indication that banks will start to behave themselves any time soon.<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1001" src="https://empiahanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/atlas_bjc0tal9e2x.png?resize=640%2C366" alt="atlas_BJC0taL9e@2x" width="640" height="366" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Deutsche were in the news last year becuase of a proposed £14bn fine from the US regulators, after it was reported that they miss-sold mortgage securities (RMBS) in the US, I believe the actual amount agreed was closer to £3bn &#8211; but this is showing that the financial crisis era penalties are all but over.

It isn&#8217;t just the initial fine that is bad news for the company in question (Deutsche had $5.5bn set aside for fines and litigation last year), the companies share price also takes a dive. This means anyone with stock in the company stands to have their personal net worth diminished. Then there is the whole Deutsche bonus issue in early 2017&#8230; Wounds which I am sure are still very fresh for employees of the German bank.

As we have talked about before in this blog, investors are always looking to make money from weird and wonderful securities. We have talked about a [watch security](https://empiah-analysis.com/2016/11/10/watch-the-market/) where the value is tied to a certain model/year of a watch, and although there are some hurdles (who gives prices each day? I don&#8217;t want a LIBOR/Chicken pricing scandal on my hands), we think this is something that could work.

Our next proposal is a kind of Swap based on bank fines.

Now this also wouldn&#8217;t work for many reasons, but again it seems relatively interesting so lets talk through it.

The Swap would work like an Interest Rate Swap where two parties would pay a different stream of capital each, but instead of one floating and one fixed, it would be two different institutions. For example one side of the swap would pay the fines of Deutsche and one the fines for Morgan Stanley &#8211; and the contract would be settled at the end of a time period with the exchange of the difference going to the side with less fines. Of course we wouldn&#8217;t suggest paying the actual amounts, but instead assign each million  (or maybe billion) a value and use that.

Now there is another issue where some companies are just bigger than others, work in multiple countries or have more propensity to get fined. For this you could factor in a multiple or a %. So say RBC vs. Nomura + 5%. Of course you would have to agree on these terms. I hope this is starting to make more sense now. Another way of doing this would be to just have a fixed amount vs. an Institutional, e.g. JPMorgan vs. $5bn. In this case the payer of the fixed would be betting that JPMorgan would have fines above that amount.

Now naturally, banks could not hold Swaps that they are involved in, this could lead to all types of problems. But they could be used by investors to hedge if they have great exposure to a certain bank or lump a load together it could be used to build the &#8216;Justice Fund&#8217; where you look to profit off banking fines.

Now people may be thinking, &#8220;Why are you selecting a Swap to use for this&#8221;. Well to be honest it seemed like the most interesting method to me. Also, it could be argued that banks getting fines is a definite thing that will always happen each year so you couldn&#8217;t have a security that said if or not there would be **any** fines. I also like the idea of people putting two banks against each other and seeing who is better behaved, I mean could it actually compel them to behave better? Probably (almost definitely) not.

I do actually like the idea of the fines being used in options too. Instead of a strike price you have the USD amount in fines (to the nearest 10 million say). I can imagine the headlines when a fine is announced and investors are rushing to the SEC saying &#8220;actually I think you should put that up a bit&#8221; or &#8220;that is way too much they only defrauded 1o0 million homeowners don&#8217;t take it out on them&#8221;, or trying to get them to push it back to after the date that the option will expire.

Even better, I can imagine front page pictures of SEC officials who have been sentenced by their employer for buying Short Dated OTM Call Options on the Goldman Bank Fine security, after they get the inside track that they are being landed with a big number.

Overall, I just want to state that this is purely written for my own amusement and not for actual implementation. Plus anything I have mentioned is just a high-level idea and would not work if it was actually made into a security. Nevertheless, I think its a fun concept.
