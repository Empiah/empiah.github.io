This is the first instalment of what will be a regular addition to the site, where we will look at football, both from a general and a data analytics perspective.

This first article will focus on what is dubbed &#8216;lazy recruitment&#8217;, where clubs may invest in players that might be over or undervalued in the transfer market.

## Lazy Recruitment

<span style="font-weight:400;">When underdogs achieve against the odds, it presents a big opportunity for clubs to poach talent that might not have been as obvious before. Last seasons Ajax side and Monaco’s team of 2017 are two recent examples. Leicester&#8217;s famous league-winning side in 2016 showed evidence of both shrewd and lazy recruitment from those to wanted to take advantage. Coincidentally, Chelsea were at the centre of both of these cases. Whilst Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez were both pivotal to Leicester success that year and won most of the plaudits, many overlooked what was the underlying secret to their success. N&#8217;golo Kante managed to go under the radar despite registering the league’s most tackles (175) and the most interceptions (156). Chelsea however didn&#8217;t miss this, and bought the midfielder for £32 million which has proved to have found excellent value in the market. He went on to win the PFA Player of the Year and the World Cup amongst other prestigious honours. Chelsea failed to find such value a year later when they signed Kante’s Leicester midfield partner Danny Drinkwater for £35 million despite consistently being behind Kante statistically. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">We feel this is evidence of lazy recruitment from Chelsea, who tried to repeat their astute acquisition of Kante without the same level of diligence. Drinkwater has struggled to make any kind of impact on the pitch since the move and has certainly lost market value with the club reportedly struggling to offload him. </span>

### Interceptions

### Tackles

<span style="font-weight:400;">The huge success of Virgil Van Dijk&#8217;s move to Liverpool in January 2018 has propelled the transfer fees being demanded for top centre backs meaning there is a real struggle to find value in the current market. Many eyebrows were raised when Liverpool paid £75 million for the Dutchman, but a phenomenal eighteen months that saw Van Dijk win PFA Player of the Year and Liverpool win the Champions League has fully justified the fee. As a result, extra focus has been put on the need  to strengthen defences. This has been highlighted by Harry Maguire&#8217;s recent £80m move to Manchester United. Despite Van Djik’s success, it is a huge ask for Maguire to have the same impact at Old Trafford.  It also gave a knock-on effect when Leicester enquired about Maguire’s potential replacement and were consequently quoted £75 million for Bournemouth’s Nathan Ake. It’s clear that other Premier League clubs have operated a ‘if a player is worth X amount, then our player is worth at least Y’ which has spiked asking prices. In order to find the best value, Premier League teams will have to look outside of the UK where fees seem to be generally lower. This will require more challenging and smarter scouting, but Wolves showed that there are big gains to be made with smart recruitment when in summer 2018 they signed Willy Boly for just £10 million from Porto. Boly went on to statistically outperform Maguire in the 2018/19 season whilst playing for similarly performing teams, showing that in an increasingly costly market there is still great value to be found. </span>
