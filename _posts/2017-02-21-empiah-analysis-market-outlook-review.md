At the back end of 2016 Empiah Analysis wrote a market outlook for 2017; in this article we will revisit how our predictions have fared so far this year. You can find the original post [here](https://empiah-analysis.com/2016/12/29/empiah-analysis-2017-market-outlook/).

To summarise, this is what we thought would happen in 2017:

Equities:

  * US &#8211; Flat Overall 
      * Technology &#8211; Bullish
      * Financials &#8211; Bullish
      * Healthcare &#8211; Bullish
  * Europe &#8211; Flat
  * Emerging Markets &#8211; Bullish

Fixed Income:

  * US Government Bonds &#8211; Bearish

## Equities

### Technology

This year has been good for technology companies. Apple and Google have reached all-time highs and show no signs of stopping. Below is the US Technology Index (DSTC) which shows that the Technology sector has bounded upwards in 2017:<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-907" src="https://empiahanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/us-technology-update.png?resize=640%2C235" alt="us-technology-update" width="640" height="235" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Prediction as at time of writing: **Correct** 

### Financials

News of out of the Trump administration still support deregulation which has helped drive up the Financials sector. Some banks (HSBC) have shown bad results but on the whole financials have had a good start to the year:

Prediction as at time of writing: **Correct &#8211; modest gains**

### Healthcare

Trump was seen as being the more &#8216;healthcare friendly&#8217; of the two nominees last year. With Hillary supporting more regulation and controls around the pricing of drugs. We can see that so far the Trump-effect has been working:

Prediction as at time of writing: **Correct**

### Europe

There has been some uncertainty in Europe regarding election&#8217;s, the most key of those being France. The gap between French and German 10 year bonds yields is the highest since 2012 which gives an indication into the uncertainty investors have that Le Pen will get elected and leave the EU. That being so, the iShares Europe ETF is moderately up this year so far:

Prediction as at time of writing: **Incorrect &#8211; modest gains**

### Emerging Markets

There has recently been a stream of money pouring into Emerging Markets, with a renewed confidence in the asset class. This looks set to continue as stronger data is reported out of EM:

Prediction as at time of writing: **Correct**

## Fixed Income

### US Government Bonds

US Government bonds have seen high inflation data bump yields as the CPI rose 0.6% in January, which was above the 0.3% increase expected. This increase in yields conversely leads a decrease in price. The continued momentum of US stocks has also meant that US FI has been left behind:
