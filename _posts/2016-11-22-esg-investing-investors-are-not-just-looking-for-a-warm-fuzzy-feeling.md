ESG (Environmental, Social & Governance) Investing has become huge over the past year or so, with many new funds being launched with ESG in mind.

As of September this year, over a thousand asset managers had become signatories of the UN-Backed Principles for Responsible Investments. So they&#8217;ve actually committed to incorporating sustainability issues into their investment processes.

The idea of this investment strategy is to buy into companies that:

  * Are leaders in their industries
  * Are better managed and are more forward-thinking
  * Are better at anticipating and mitigating risk
  * Meet positive standards of corporate responsibility
  * Are focused on the long term

The assets to which money managers apply ESG criteria have increased significantly from $4.8 trillion in 2014 to $8.1 trillion in 2016 (source: [usiff.org)](http://www.ussif.org/sribasics). It has also been recently been identified by survey&#8217;s that the number of investors that think about ESG related issues outnumber those that don&#8217;t.

When this investment strategy started out there was a pre-conception that it may not generate the same level of returns that could be enjoyed by funds that were not constrained by the criteria. We can see from the data in this post that this is not necessarily the case. For example, investigations by [Hermes](https://www.hermes-investment.com/ukw/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2015/11/esg-investing-does-it-just-make-you-feel-good-or-is-it-actually-good-for-your-portfolio.pdf) show that that well-governed companies have tended to outperform poorly governed companies by an average of over 30 basis points per month over the last five years.

Taking a look at fund returns, the _Henderson Horizon Pan European Equity Fund A2 EUR Acc _is rated 4/5 on ESG by Morningstar and we can see from the below that this is outperforming its benchmark (MSCI Europe):

This is one example of ESG funds generating solid returns against a benchmark, and there are many other funds doing the same.

One area in which ESG can be used to mitigate risk is in Emerging Market&#8217;s. EM is an area of investing that can generate high returns but that does come with high risks that are not necessarily present in developed markets. For example, there is not always a structure in place to prioritise shareholders as many companies are state-owned (China comes to mind). Asset managers and other investors would need to look at the historic governance within EM companies, and whether they have abused any minority shareholders, their employees, the environment or any other areas of society.

In an interview with [Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/149717/can-esg-investing-mitigate-risk-in-emerging-markets.aspx) James Donald (Fund manager at Lazard) said:

> We want to see that management, for instance, if possible, is encouraged through variable compensation that&#8217;s logically derived, that&#8217;s material and that hopefully is paid to a large degree in restricted shares because we think we&#8217;re very aligned with groups on that basis.

If detailed research can be conducted to screen EM companies, using some of the criteria above, it _could_ be used to reduce the risk of investing in EM.

For anyone looking to research more into ESG stocks, [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/best-worst-esg-stocks-ratings-reuters-intel-astrazeneca-apple) recently noted the below as some of the best performing ESG stock using Thomson Reuters Corporate Responsibility Ratings:

  * **AstraZeneca**: ESG 85.15
  * **Intel**: ESG 83.4

For reference, some of the lowest:

  * **EchoStar Corp**: ESG 32.6
  * **Rex Minerals Ltd**: ESG 32

I will be writing more about ESG in the future, and will look to research more into the stocks above.
