It has been a while since I have posted on here, partly due to a period of rest after the CFA L1 exam, but mainly due to the fact that I have been learning how to code using [Python](https://www.python.org/).

I chose Python because my main objective was that of data analysis, and the functionality that is available both out-of-the-box and with packages like Pandas meant that it was a perfect tool for the job. I used to make websites way back in the day so coding itself was not too alien to me, but getting back into the swing of things took some time, not to mention it is a totally different language.

I decided to enrol in the nano degree in Data Analysis from Udacity, and I must say it has been really enjoyable (not to mention less stressful when compared to the CFA exams). Having deadlines for assignments keeps you on track, and having projects to work on means that you have to go away and research things for yourself, not to mention learning &#8216;on-the-job&#8217; is in my opinion the best way to do things.

Anyway, after completing the most recent assignment I decided to use my new found skills to good use and analyse some data in relation to tube stations and their entry and exit figures. The aim was to put together a histogram showing where the busiest stations were based on average hourly entry.

The first thing that I had to do was source information which gave me entry and exit figures for the different stations, and luckily TFL has this available on their [site](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-underground-performance-reports).Â I then sourced the longitude and latitude for each of these stations from the [openstreetmap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/List_of_London_Underground_stations).

From here it was time to jump into [Atom](https://atom.io/) and get coding. Eventually I will set-up a GitHub account and make this available &#8211; but below is the end result:

I will eventually get round to overlaying an actual London map so that it makes it all a bit clearer, but I am happy with how it turned out. You can see that the busier stations are in the centre as expected, with the outer stations being comparably quieter.

I will put some more projects up here when I have the time (and ability) to do so, but I recommend everyone to learn to code at least to a basic level as it is really interesting, not to mention useful in the modern age.
