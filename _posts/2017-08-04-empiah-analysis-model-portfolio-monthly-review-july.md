It has been a while since anything has been posted here, which I will blame on the fact that I am in the middle of studying for exams at the moment&#8230; but I do have plans to start posting more soon.

Please see below for the monthly review for both portfolios for the month of May. Note that all excess return numbers stated are arithmetic.

## Performance vs. Index

### Top-Down Model Portfolio

A lot has happened in this portfolio and that is clear from the graph at the top. After under-performing significantly in the month of June, trailing the index by 246bp; we came back in a big way in July, smashing the index by 250bps. The majority of this volatility has been due to our heavy weighting to the technology sector and in August we have seen technology rally yet again after solid earnings from a number of our holdings, namely Apple, NVIDIA and Intel. Because price now look very expensive compared to earnings we are reviewing some of  our holdings and it is likely a re-allocation will occur in the near future.

As we can see we are outperforming by 36bps for 3 months, and in a time where active managers are struggling to generate alpha we see this as positive.

### Bottom-Up Model Portfolio

This portfolio has seen much less volatility and has tracked the benchmark more closely. June saw out-performance (49bps) and July saw under-performance (56bps), the complete opposite to our Top Down portfolio. Because of the concentrated stock base we always believed that this would be more stable and representative of the holdings in the wider benchmark. The same concerns still exist around Price/Earnings ratios and we are reviewing our positions to be better positioned should there be a pullback.

When we look at the same 3 month numbers reviewed above we can see we are trailing the index by 55bps, we still have conviction in our positions and believe the are well paced to outperform going forwards.
