EURNOK Â has hit a resistance level at around 8.929 and I would look for a rebound upwards. There is also a wedge forming which further emphasises the long recommendation.

We can also see an uptrend on CCI and RSI was close to being oversold before it showed some momentum upwards.

I would look for a return to the diagonal trendline as a first target, and a return to around 9.12 as a second target.
