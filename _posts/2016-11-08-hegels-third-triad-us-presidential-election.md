Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel described the relationship between three abstract terms known as the triad &#8211; these terms were; thesis, antithesis and synthesis and were defined in the following way:

1) a beginning proposition called a thesis **(primaries)** (2) a negation of that thesis called the antithesis **(debates & campaign trail)** and (3) a synthesis whereby the two conflicting ideas are reconciled to form a new proposition **(election night) **

Talking about the 2016 US Presidential race from abroad is far easier than it would be for people that live in the US. I can happily poke fun at both candidates and won&#8217;t feel responsible for any negative affects as I could not vote in the outcome. A lot of what I see is also shaped by my curated Facebook feed, which as we have seen recently in the news can be manipulated by their algorithms. I will, however, feel the outcomes of whatever is decided by the american electorate.

As we can see from the graph below the market is looking at Hillary as being better for the economy. This isn&#8217;t becuase her policies necessarily favour investors, actually the opposite could be the case, but it is becuase she is seen as being more predictable. Stocks had their best day since March after the FBI announced that Email Investigation Round 2 yielded no negative results for Clinton, improving her odds of winning the keys to the Oval office in the eyes of investors.

Supporting this argument &#8211; since the 1920&#8217;s the market has actually preferred Democratic presidents, with the market gaining an average of 96% for the seven democrat&#8217;s vs 29% for eight republican terms.

Below we can see some key events in US history along with the relevant party in charge:

As I write this, Hillary is forecast as the winner by the polls by an ever growing majority even though results are only just starting to flow in.

Polls are a topic by which many people are divided, there can be private and public polls, with some being cheap to commission (send some people out on the street with a clipboard) and some being expensive (pay someone to think of eye opening questions which no-one has thought of before and target many specific sectors of society). To try and get a better idea of what will happen there have been reports of hedge funds and other financial institutions paying 6 (or possibly 7?) figures to commission private polls to try and get more accurate data than everyone else. Does this mean that somewhere someone has some super-accurate poll that knows the result of the election? Maybe. Does it mean that this someone will make millions off the back of this data? Maybe.

One way of investing into the election would be to put your money into something with a lot of exposure to Mexico and the Peso, for example the New York-listed iShares MSCI Mexico Capped ETF. This actually, gave a big signal towards a Clinton victory earlier today.

  When we look at volume we can also see that this instrument has been used extensively by investors:

  Whatever the result today, and whoever is inaugurated on January 20th 2017, there will certainly be affects felt by the worldwide economy. No-one knows exactly what will happen, but sitting here in the UK I can safely say I do not envy my friends and colleagues  across the pond, and that says a lot considering we are currently embroiled in a post-Brexit vote/unelected Prime Minister/Prince Harry girlfriend abusing mess.
