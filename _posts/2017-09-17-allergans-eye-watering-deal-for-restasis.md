For anyone that follows Allergan, it is clear how much the company relies on Restasis, its dry-eye drug that is second only to Botox in terms of revenue generating products.

Earlier this week they made a deal with a tribe in a bid to avoid patent challenges, the below is an extract from a Reuters [article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-allergan-patents/challenge-of-allergan-tribal-patent-deal-in-uncharted-legal-territory-idUSKCN1BP31A).

> Last week, Allergan announced it would transfer the patent rights to its Restasis dry-eye treatment to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which will license them back to the company in exchange for ongoing payments.
> 
> Allergan says the tribe’s sovereign immunity puts the patents beyond the authority of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, an administrative court created in 2012 that can cancel patents.

In my opinion, one that wouldn&#8217;t be shared by patent lawyers and competitors, this is a great move as they look to keep their market share in dry eye products. The drug itself brought in and eye watering (pun intended) 1.4 billion in 2016, so you can see how much it needs to keep hold of it.

The Dry-Eye war is not quite over though as Shire and their Xiidra drug (the first new prescription treatment since Restasis was announced in 2003) are battling to take customers from Allergan, and they are doing pretty well, capturing around 22% of the U.S Market in Q1 2017.

Below is a [graph](https://www.theatlas.com/charts/S1iTKRsqZ) which shows both the products revenues as % of total company revenues (using quarterly data points).

We can see the dependence of Allergan on Restasis, but also a notable downtrend since the launch of Xiidra. This may be a sign of things to come as Opthamologists, seem to think that there are [benefits of switching](https://eyelovethesun.com/blogs/news/xiidra-versus-restasis) to the newer offering.

The graph below shows both stock prices, and in a market where healthcare has outperformed, they have not done so well.

Only time will tell if they will perform better in the future and if the Dry Eye Battle will have a major part to play.
