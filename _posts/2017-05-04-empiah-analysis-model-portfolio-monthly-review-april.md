Last month we introduced our the Empiah Portfolio model portfolio and said that we would actively monitor, track and update the portfolio according to our internal preferences. This is the first monthly review and here we will talk through the performance, holdings and trading activity.

The majority of the stocks within our portfolio are not only chosen based on our outlook for that company, but also on what we will call the Empiah Analysis Themes. These are certain long-term trends that we believe will shape the world economy &#8211; we will go onto explain these themes in a future post.

## Performance vs Index

We have measured our portfolio against a US Large-Cap Blend Equity Benchmark as we feel that this is most appropriate, please note that this performance graph is from Inception (27th March 2017) to the 4th May.  As you can see performance lagged the benchmark for a period around the middle of the month, but we have seen some recent out-performance at the start of May due to strong earnings and a change in the macro environment. This has meant that over the period we have matched the benchmark performance and generated one month return of 1.34%.
